## Task
The problem of mutual arrangement of electromagnetic scatterers.

Physical formulation of the problem:

On a segment of unit length there are 10 induced dipoles that absorb and scatter electromagnetic radiation incident at right angles to the segment. The problem is to find the coordinates of the dipoles on a unit length segment at which the energy absorbed per unit time is minimal.
